# What is RogueSharp? #
RogueSharp is a free library written in C# to help [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike "roguelike") developers get a head start on their game. RogueSharp provides many utility functions for dealing with map generation, field-of-view calculations, path finding, random number generation and more.

It is loosely based on the popular [libtcod](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ "libtcod") or "Doryen Library" though not all features overlap.

## Getting Started ##
1. Visit the [RogueSharp Blog](http://roguesharp.wordpress.com/ "RogueSharp Blog") for tips and tutorials.
2. The quickest way to add RogueSharp to your project is by using the [RogueSharp nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RogueSharp "RogueSharp nuget package"). 
2. If building the assembly yourself, the solution file "RogueSharp.sln" contains the main library and unit tests. This should be all you need.
3. The solution file "RogueSharpPerformanceTests.sln" contains a wrapper for libtcod and was only used to test performance of similar functions between RogueSharp and libtcod
4. The solution file "RogueSharpDocumentation.sln" requires [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://shfb.codeplex.com/ "Sandcastle Help File Builder") to be installed. It can be used to generate documentation for the library from the XML comments on public methods.


## Creating a Map ##
Most interactions with RogueSharp is based around the concept of a `Map` which is a rectangular grid of `Cells`. 

Each `Cell` in a `Map` has the following properties:

- `IsTransparent`: true if visibility extends through the `Cell`.
- `IsWalkable`: true if a the `Cell` may be traversed by the player
- `IsExplored`: true if the player has ever had line-of-sight to the `Cell`
- `IsInFov`: true if the `Cell` is currently in the player's field-of-view

To instantiate a new `Map` you can use its constructor which takes a width and height and will create a new map of those dimensions with the properties of all `Cells` set to false.
    
###Usage###

	IMap boringMapOfSolidStone = new Map( 5, 3 );
	Console.WriteLine( boringMapOfSolidStone.ToString() );

###Output###

Notice that the `ToString()` operator is overridden on the `Map` class to provide a simple visual representation of the map. An optional bool parameter can be provided to `ToString()` to indicate if you want to use the field-of-view or not. If the parameter is not given it defaults to false. 

The symbols used are as follows:

- `%`: `Cell` is not in field-of-view
- `.`: `Cell` is transparent, walkable, and in field-of-view
- `s`: `Cell` is walkable and in field-of-view (but not transparent)
- `o`: `Cell` is transparent and in field-of-view (but not walkable)
- `#`: `Cell` is in field-of-view (but not transparent or walkable)

A more interesting way to create a map is to use the `Map` class's static method `Create` which takes an `IMapCreationStrategy`. Some simple classes implementing `IMapCreationStrategy` are provided with RogueSharp but this is easily extended by creating your own class that implements the strategy.

###Usage###

	IMapCreationStrategy<Map> mapCreationStrategy = new RandomRoomsMapCreationStrategy<Map>( 17, 10, 30, 5, 3 )
	IMap somewhatInterestingMap = Map.Create( mapCreationStrategy );
	Console.WriteLine( somewhatInterestingMap.ToString() );

###Output###
